## Tracking Locations

* I use [this smart switch](http://amzn.to/2oruAY3) to measure current (I use an older version that's not sold any more).
Check out [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) for watching media.
* I use [Home Assistant's device tracker](https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker/) to scan my network for phones.
