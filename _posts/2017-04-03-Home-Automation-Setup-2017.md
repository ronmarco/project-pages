# Intro

I kept the video high-level, so let me know what you'd like to learn more about. See below for additional information and links to the devices I use.

# Smarter Devices

## Tracking Locations

I use [this smart switch](http://amzn.to/2oruAY3) to measure current (I use an older version that's not sold any more).

Check out [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) for watching media.

I use [Home Assistant's device tracker](https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker/) to scan my network for phones. 

## Making Old Devices "Smart"

I use [this IR blaster](http://amzn.to/2oOYPnJ) to control my TV. Cheaper ones have come out since I bought the above, such as [this](http://amzn.to/2nuZfyx ) (Even cheaper on AliExpress.com, search "Broadlink RM Mini3")

## Alarm Clock

I make an alarm clock in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ8ZoJuuZVA).

# Saving Electricity

I send notifications through [Pushbullet](https://home-assistant.io/components/notify.pushbullet/).

I use [nmap](https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.nmap_tracker/) to track the status of my computers.

I use [Philips Hue bulbs](http://amzn.to/2ornwdA) for lights. If you already have a Hue hub, you can get [cheap bulbs here](http://www.homedepot.com/p/Philips-60W-Equivalent-Soft-White-A19-Hue-Connected-Home-LED-Light-Bulb-455295/206633282).

[This link](https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/do-hue-led-bulbs-use-a-fixed-amount-of-power-relative-to-brightness/1793) talks about Hue power usage by brightness.

# Improved Interactions

I use an [Alexa Tap](http://amzn.to/2nyxmGI) in the video. I like the portability of the Tap, especially since the firmware update.

# Visitors & Vacation

Vacation mode was inspired by [Github user "geekofweek"](https://github.com/geekofweek/homeassistant).

# Automation Tips

Learn about Input Booleans [on the Home Assistant website](https://home-assistant.io/components/input_boolean/).

My Excel tracker is disorganized and confusing right now, but let me know if you're interested in it and I'll clean it up and share it.

Thanks for reading!
